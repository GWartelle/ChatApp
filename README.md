<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

<h2 id="about-the-project">About The Project</h2>

![ChatApp Home Page Screenshot](./public/discussion_screen.png)

If you want to take a direct look at this project, you can do so right [here](https://chatapp-oy8v.onrender.com/).

This project was built following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwCqsOis894).

ChatApp is a realtime messaging web app, built using the MERN Stack ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)).

On the backend, we have some basic CRUD operations: creating and deleting a user account, logging in and out, creating and reading messages, and reading users.
The connection to the database is set up using [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), passwords are encrypted using [Bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js#readme), the authentication and authorization is delt with using [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/), and the real-time messaging using [Socket.io](https://socket.io/).

On the frontend, we use [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for navigation as this is a SPA, we use [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) for global state management, and [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/) for user notifications. The styling is done with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/).

This project is hosted on [Render](https://render.com/) and utilizes their power-efficient servers, which spin down after periods of inactivity. As a result, you may experience a slightly longer loading time as the server spins back up for use.

<!-- FOLDER STRUCTURE -->

<h2 id="folder-structure">Folder Structure</h2>

<h3 id="root">Root folder</h3>

Let me present to you the folder structure of this project, with its main components.

In the root folder, we find the following files: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, `package.json` with the backend packages, and `.env.example` used as a base to set up the `.env` file for replicating this project.

We also find the `public/` folder with the images used for this `README.md` file.

The rest of the project is divided in the two folders: the `backend/` folder for the server, and the `frontend/` folder for the client.

<h3 id="server">Backend folder</h3>

In the `backend/` folder, we first have the `server.js` file where the bases of the server is set up.

Then, in `backend/`, we find multiple folders :

`controllers/` with the `auth.controllers.js`, `message.controllers.js` and `user.controllers.js` files, which are the controllers used in the routes of the same name.

`db/` with the `connectToMongoDB.js` file to set up the connection to the MongoDB database.

`middleware/` with the `protectRoute.js` middleware used to verify the token of the user.

`models/` with the `conversation.model.js`, `message.model.js` and `user.model.js` files which set up their respective mongoose models.

`routes/` with the `auth.routes.js`, `message.routes.js` and `user.routes.js` files, which set up their respective routes.

`socket/` with the `socket.js` file to set up the connection to Socket.io.

And `utils/` with the `generateToken.js` file used to generate a token when the user registers or logs in.

<h3 id="client">Frontend folder</h3>

Now for the `frontend/` folder, the most important files are the `index.html` file on which the app sits on, the `package.json` file once again for the packages, and configurations files for Vite.js, TailwindCSS and ESLint.

Next, in `frontend/`, there is also a `public/` folder with the images for the favicon and the background.

Then, still in `frontend/`, there's the `src/` folder where most of the frontend finds its place.
In `src/`, we find `main.jsx` which sets up React, `App.jsx` that sets up the routes, and `index.css` with a few global styles.

For the rest of `src/`, we find multiple folders:

`assets/sounds` with the notification sound (not used in this version of the project).

`components/` has itself multiple folders: `messages/` with all the components used for messages, `modals/` with the delete account modal, `sidebar/` with all the components that compose the sidebar, and `skeletons/` with the skeleton used for messages.

`context/` with the `AuthContext.jsx` and `SocketContext.jsx` files that set up their respectiv context.

`hooks/` with all the hooks called throughout the application.

`pages/` with the `home/`, `login/` and `signup/` folders, each their respective page.

`utils/` with `emojis.js` that generate a random emoji, and `extractTime.js` that formats time correctly for messages.

And finally `zustand/` for state management files.

That's it for the folder structure !

<!-- CLONING THE PROJECT -->

<h2 id="cloning-the-project">Cloning the project</h2>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

If you want to clone this project, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed, as well as [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

1. To clone this project, first go in the directory you want to install the project in :

   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/directory
   ```

2. And then run this command to clone the project :

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GWartelle/ChatApp.git
   ```

<h3 id="backend">Backend</h3>

1. For the backend, in the root of the project, start by running the command `npm install` to install all the packages :

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Next, in the editor of your choice, open the `.env.example` file. For example, using VSCode, you can run this command :

   ```sh
   code .env.example
   ```

3. Update the environment variables with your own :

   ```js
   PORT=...
   MONGO_DB_URI=...
   JWT_SECRET=...
   NODE_ENV=...
   ```

   For the `PORT`, you can choose whichever one you prefer.

   For the `MONGO_DB_URI`, you can create your own free database on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

   For `JWT_SECRET`, a random string of characters will do the trick.
   To easily create one, open a bash terminal and run this commmand :

   ```ba
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

   For `NODE_ENV`, leave it as `development` unless you plan to deploy the app, in which case you should change it to `production`.

4. Once it's done, change the name of the file to `.env` :

   ```sh
   mv .env.example .env
   ```

5. Lastly, to start the server using nodemon, run this command :

   ```sh
   npm run server
   ```

<h3 id="frontend">Frontend</h3>

1. For the frontend, you must go in the frontend folder and run the command `npm install` :

   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. And to run the React app using Vite.js, run this command :

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

3. You can now click on the link after `Local:` to open up the project on the browser of your choice.

<!-- MODIFICATIONS -->

<h2 id="modifications">Modifications</h2>

Compared to the original project, I decided to tweak things a little bit: I changed the background, I got rid of the notification sound and the shaking animation of new messages as it was getting rather annoying 😅, etc ...

But one major thing I added to this project is the delete account feature, as I think it really is a requirement.

So I wanted to share with you how I did to implement this function.
To begin with, let's take a look a the backend logic, the `deleteAccount` controller :

```js
export const deleteAccount = async (req, res) => {
 try {
   const user = req.user;

   // Delete the user's conversations
   const conversations = await Conversation.find({ participants: user._id });
   for (const conversation of conversations) {
     const messages = await Message.find({ conversation: conversation._id });
     for (const message of messages) {
       await Message.deleteOne({ _id: message._id });
     }
     await Conversation.deleteOne({ _id: conversation._id });
   }

   // Delete the user
   await User.findByIdAndDelete(user._id);

   res.clearCookie("jwt");
   res.status(204).json({ message: "Account deleted successfully" });
 } catch (error) {
   console.error("Error in delete account controller", error.message);
   res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal Server Error" });
 }
```

After getting the user from the request sent by the frontend, the controller finds all the conversations this user had.
And within each of these conversations, the controller goes through all the messages and deletes them one by one.

Once all the messages from a conversation are deleted, it is time to delete the conversation itself, and then tackle the next one.
The controller reapeat this cycle until every messages and every conversations this user had have been deleted.

When this is done, the only thing left to do for the controller is to delete the user itself, and then clear its token from the cookies to effectively log the user out.

And now let's take a look at the frontend logic that deals with this, the `useDelete` hook :

```js
const useDelete = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const { setAuthUser } = useAuthContext();

  const deleteAccount = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const res = await fetch("/api/auth/delete-account", {
        method: "DELETE",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      });
      if (!res.ok) {
        throw new Error("Failed to delete account");
      }

      localStorage.removeItem("chat-user");
      setAuthUser(null);
      toast.success("Successfully deleted account!");
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error(error.message);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return { loading, deleteAccount };
};
```

This React hook first sets up a loading state, which is initiated to false, and gets the setter of the authentication context.

The `deleteAccount` function itself then sets the loading state to true, for the time of the API call, and tries to fetch for the `delete-account` route of the backend.

After checking if the API responded correctly, the hook proceeds to remove the user from the local storage, then sets the authentication context to null and notifies the user of the successful deletion of the account.

Finally, the hook sets the loading state back to false.
This hooks returns the loading state itself and the `deleteAccount` function.

Most of the logic is now dealt with, the only thing left to do for the frontend is to call this hook, in the DeleteButton component (the trash icon) :

```js
const DeleteButton = () => {
  const { loading, deleteAccount } = useDelete();
  const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);

  const handleDeleteAccount = async () => {
    await deleteAccount();
    setIsModalOpen(false);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {!loading ? (
        <>
          <BiTrash
            className="w-6 h-6 text-white cursor-pointer"
            title="Delete Account"
            onClick={() => setIsModalOpen(true)}
          />
          <ConfirmationModal
            isOpen={isModalOpen}
            onRequestClose={() => setIsModalOpen(false)}
            onConfirm={handleDeleteAccount}
          />
        </>
      ) : (
        <span className="loading loading-spinner"></span>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

This component first gets the `loading` state and the `deleteAccount` function from the `useDelete()` hook.

Next, it creates a `isModalOpen` state to control the display of the `ConfirmationModal` component, which is by default set to false.

The `deleteAccount()` function is called by the `handleDeleteAccount` handle, which also sets the `setIsModalOpen` state to false.

When the trash icon is clicked, the `isModalOpen` state is set to true.
This state is passed on to `ConfirmationModal`, along with its setter, and the `handleDeleteAccount` handle.

So, let's finally take a look at this `ConfirmationModal` component :

```js
const ConfirmationModal = ({ isOpen, onRequestClose, onConfirm }) => {
  return (
    <Modal
      isOpen={isOpen}
      onRequestClose={onRequestClose}
      contentLabel="Confirmation Modal"
    >
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-200">Delete Account</h2>
      <p className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-300">
        Are you sure you want to delete your account?
      </p>
      <div className="flex justify-evenly">
        <button
          className="btn w-5/12 btn-sm mt-2 border border-slate-700 hover:text-white"
          onClick={onRequestClose}
        >
          No
        </button>
        <button
          className="btn w-5/12 btn-sm mt-2 border border-slate-700 hover:bg-red-700 hover:border-red-700 hover:text-white"
          onClick={onConfirm}
        >
          Yes
        </button>
      </div>
    </Modal>
  );
};
```

The `isOpen` attribute of this modal controls its display based on the `isModalOpen` state that has been passed on, which can also be set back to false with `onRequestClose`.

This modal simply asks the user to make a choice between `No` which calls `onRequestClose` and closes the modal, and `Yes` which calls the `deleteAccount` function using the handle passed on to `onConfirm`.

Once this is done, the user's account is effectively deleted, and he/she is sent back to the login page.

And that's all for the delete account feature !

<!-- IMPROVEMENTS  -->

<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>

As this project is primarily built for training purposes, it is rather light in terms of features.
Therefore, if I had more time on my hands to improve this web app, here are the features I would implement :

1. The most important point in my opinion, would be to add responsivity. This is a crucial feature for all modern web apps, and this project clearly lacks it.
2. It would also be important to have a password retrieval feature, as it is a staple of all modern apps.
3. Next, I would add a friend list feature. Instead of being able to contact every other users, one user should have to send a friend request before being able to send messages.
4. It'd be a great improvement if it was possible to upload images, videos and audios in discussions, as it is a staple feature in most real-time messaging apps.
5. Finally, it would be logical to add some account update feature. The user would be able to choose a different profile picture, select a specific emoji to represent his/her account, and could change his/her username or password.

After that, this project could benefit from other little tweaks like ordering other users' profiles based on which discussion is the most recent, notifying the user when he/she receives a new message from another discussion, adding the date to messages older than a day, or being able to create an account using google, apple or other credentials, but I think this would be a good start.
